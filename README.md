Just tried to create a simple calc for self-practice:)

I understood that I have some problems with projecting

And using git for first'ish time is painful

Anyway, If you want to try how does it work, you should download the font: https://fontstorage.com/ru/font/dalton-maag-ltd/ubuntu-mono
and add it to the C:/Windows/Fonts

I'm a newbie so don't expect much
